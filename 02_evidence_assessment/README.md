# 02. Evidence assessment

This module provides workflows for assessing read-depth (RD), paired-end (PE),
split read (SR), and B-allele frequency (BAF) evidence supporting strutural
variant calls.

Each evidence can be processed individually by running *snakemake* under each sub-directory, e.g.:
```
cd 02a_rdtest
snakemake
```

For futher details for processing each evidence, please refer to the readme under each sub-directory.

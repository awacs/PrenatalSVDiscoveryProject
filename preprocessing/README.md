# SV Preprocessing

The preprocessing module standardizes VCFs and removes calls specific to
outlying samples. Outliers are determined to be samples with more than 
`(Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)` variants observed, and are calculated on a per-algorithm,
per-svtype basis (e.g. Delly inversions).

* `std_vcfs/{source}.{quad}.vcf`  
    Standardized VCFs.  
        - INFO fields for CHR2, END, STRANDS, SVTYPE, SVLEN, and SOURCE    
        - BND ALTs are converted to VCF specification  
        - Balanced events are separated into stranded breakpoints  

* `outliers/{source}.list`  
    Tables of svtype-specific outlier samples by caller.  
        - `sample`: sample ID  
        - `svtype`: type of SV for which the sample is an outlier  
        - `var_count`: number of variants observed in the sample  
        - `cutoff`: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR for that svtype/algorithm  

* `filtered_vcfs/{source}.{quad}.vcf`  
    VCFs with calls specific to outlier samples or null in all samples removed.  

* `std_beds/`
    * `{source}/{sample}.{svtype}.raw.bed`  
        Raw calls. Columns are standardized to chrom, start, end, svsize
    * `{source}/{sample}.{svtype}.merged.bed`  
        Raw beds subjected to bedtools merged.
    * `merged_algs/{sample}.{svtype}.raw.bed`  
        Sorted concatenation of raw calls.
    * `merged_algs/{sample}.{svtype}.merged.bed`  
        Per-sample merging of raw calls across all algorithms.
    * `merged_algs/{sample}.{svtype}.cov.bed`  
        Final per-sample standardized bed. Each merged call is queried for
        coverage by each individual algorithm's callset in order to determine 
        the algorithms which predicted the variant.  Columns are chrom, start, 
        end, sample svsize, cnmops coverage, cnvnator coverage, and genomestrip 
        coverage.
